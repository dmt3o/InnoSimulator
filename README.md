## Introduction
This is Unity-based robot simulator for autonomous moving objects developed by Innopolis University. Simulator could be used by autonomous vehicle developers and end-users for testing or educational purposes.

The development of a virtual environment for modeling the behavior of a robotic autonomous moving objects will significantly reduce the cost of vehicleâ€™s development process, especially in the area of tuning and testing sensory and control equipment. This will significantly improve the safety of the car.

## Purpose
The main purpose is to create an environment for debugging and modeling the behavior of a full-fledged model in the simulator in real time and in real 3D environment, which will avoid critical design errors, quickly clarify low-level requirements for individual nodes, shift the verification process to earlier stages, carry out more iterations of the prototype research in a short period of time and save on field tests.

### Run tests with simulator
For carrying out full-scale tests and testing of the entire functionality of the simulator, [Apollo](https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo-5.0) need to be installed (preferably on another computer to achieve high-level performance). To allow the simulator communicate with Apollo you need to install Rosbridge and read installation instructions from [here](https://github.com/lgsvl/rosbridge_suite). 


1.  Run rosbridge:
```
   roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```

2.  Run Apollo:To launch apollo, first launch and enter a container as described in the same [link](https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo) as in description of this chapter.
```
   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

**Full description how to use simulator you can find [here](Docs/HowToUse.md).**

### Premade scenes
There're some example ready-to-use scenes. Every scene is dedicated to our team's internal requests for testing purposes. 

## Pyhton API
Innopolis Simulator supports Python API functionality. Full description can be found [here](Docs/PythonApi.md).
